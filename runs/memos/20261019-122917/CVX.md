# CVX: Underweight

Desk memo, 2026-10-19. Price 224.99 (2026-10-16). Noise meter agreement 100% (Underweight). Target weight 0.0%.

## Why

- price / base fair value 1.27 at Medium uncertainty (volatility 24%, range 1.17x base, DCF / industry multiples 0.87): Buy at or below 0.70, Overweight to 0.93, Underweight from 1.07, Sell from 1.35

## Valuation

Method: FCFF DCF at company WACC (maturing toward beta 1 from above): trailing revenue growth held 5 years if at most 10%, otherwise decaying to 10% by year 5, then fading to terminal growth = risk-free rate over 5 years; reinvestment = change in revenue / operating sales-to-capital; SBC expensed; R&D capitalized where material; leases as debt; terminal ROIC keeps the moat share (from 5-year ROIC history) of today's excess return; bear/base/bull shift growth -/+4 points, margin -/+10% relative, WACC +/-0.5 points, moat share 0/history/1

| Bear | Base | Bull | Price / base |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 116.32 | 176.89 | 323.40 | 1.27 |

| Cost of capital | Value |
|---|---:|
| Risk-free (2026-09-01 (rate in Damodaran's ERP computation)) | 4.8% |
| Beta (Oil/Gas (Integrated); regression 0.8) | 0.65 |
| Equity risk premium | 4.1% |
| Cost of equity | 7.4% |
| Synthetic rating (coverage 20.04) | AAA |
| Cost of debt, pre-tax | 5.1% |
| Equity weight | 92.3% |
| **WACC** (maturing to 7.2%) | **7.2%** |

- Revenue growth: last twelve months 11.2%, 3-year CAGR -7.8%, blend 1.7% (used 1.7%); the price implies 8.8%
- Operating margin 13.7% (reported 13.7% + R&D adjustment 0.0%), ROIC 9.9%, sales-to-capital 0.981, SBC 0.0% of revenue
- Moat: only 0 years of ROIC history: narrow by default
- Industry multiples check: Oil/Gas (Integrated) EV/EBIT 15.2x gives 202.77 per share; DCF / multiples 0.872
- Terminal value 65.4% of enterprise value; EV/EBIT at base 13.4x vs market 16.7x
- Period: trailing twelve months to 2026-06-30 (revenue growth: twelve months to 2026-06-30 vs to 2025-06-30), from 10-K and 10-Q XBRL; the readers' evidence comes from the latest 10-K, 10-Q and earnings release
